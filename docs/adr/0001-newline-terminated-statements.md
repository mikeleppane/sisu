# Statements end at newlines, not semicolons

Sisu has no `;`. The lexer inserts a `Newline` token at a line break after a
token that can end a statement (Go's rule), unless the innermost open bracket
is `(` (Python's rule, stopped at `{` so a block inside parentheses still
separates statements). We chose this over Rust-style semicolons so programs
read without punctuation on every line; the cost sits in the lexer, where it
is easy to test. See the milestone 1 spec, "Statements end at newlines".

## Considered options

- **Rust-style `;`**: a simpler lexer, but a block's value then depends on
  whether its last expression has a `;` (`x` versus `x;`), and every line
  carries punctuation.

## Consequences

- Layout rules: an operator ends a line rather than starting the next one,
  `{` stays on the line of its `fn`, `if` or `while`, and `} else` stays on
  one line.
- `-` is both unary and binary, so a line starting with `-` and a space is an
  error; otherwise `a` followed by a line `- b` would compile as two
  statements.
- Every later piece of syntax must be checked against the insertion rule.
  Already decided: from milestone 2, a line starting with `.` continues the
  previous one, so method chains can put each call on its own line (as in
  Swift and Kotlin).
