# Contributing to Sisu

Sisu is a solo learning project, and most changes are written with an AI
agent. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) holds the rules for changing this tree, for
people and agents alike. This page is the route through them.

1. Set up a clone as [Developing Sisu](docs/development.md) describes. The
   pre-commit hook runs the same checks as CI.
2. Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md): the commands, the lint policy, and how to
   check facts about dependencies.
3. Read [CODING_STANDARDS.md](CODING_STANDARDS.md): the judgement calls that
   reviewers check and no linter can.
4. Use the words in [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md), and read the decisions in
   [docs/adr](docs/adr) that touch your change.
5. Finish with `cargo nextest run --workspace`, `prek run --all-files` and
   `cargo deny check` passing, as CI requires. Then run `cargo mutants` on
   your diff, as [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) shows, and kill or explain each
   surviving mutant.

Work is tracked as local Markdown issues under `.scratch/`, as
[docs/agents/issue-tracker.md](docs/agents/issue-tracker.md) describes.

## Pull requests

A pull request says what changed and why, then what a reviewer cannot see
from the diff: which contract each new test proves, what was left out of
scope, and what is known not to work yet.

Before you open one, run the `update-docs` skill
([.agents/skills/update-docs/SKILL.md](.agents/skills/update-docs/SKILL.md))
so the docs match the change.
