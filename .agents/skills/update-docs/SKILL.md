description: Use in the Sisu repo before opening a pull request, or when one merged without a docs pass, if a change to sisuc, the runtime, CLI flags, language features, the toolchain, the repository layout, or milestone status may have left the README, guides, architecture diagram, roadmap, glossary or ADRs stale.

# Update the docs after a change

The docs describe what `main` does. Before a pull request, bring them back
in line with its code. Change only what the diff made untrue or incomplete,
check every claim against the code or a real run, and report what you
changed and what you left alone.

Run this on the pull request's branch before you open it. Run it after a
merge only when the user asks, or when the pull request merged without it.

## 1. Find the change

Run plain git from the repository root, one command per call. Start with
`git fetch origin`, so `origin/main` is current.

- Before a pull request: `git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD`, then
  `git diff origin/main...HEAD -- <path>` for each file that matters.
- For a branch that is not checked out: the same, with `<branch>` for
  `HEAD`. `git show <branch>:<path>` reads a file as that branch has it.
- After a merge: find the merge commit with
  `gh pr view <number> --json mergeCommit`, then
  `git diff <merge-sha>^1 <merge-sha> -- <path>`.

If the pull request exists, read its body with `gh pr view <number>`. It
names what is out of scope and what does not work yet.

## 2. Map the change to the docs

Read each target below before you decide it needs no edit.

| The diff changes | Check and update |
| --- | --- |
| Flags or usage text in `crates/sisuc/src/main.rs` | The "Look inside the compiler" table in `docs/development.md`; the Driver card in `docs/architecture/sisu-pipeline.json` |
| A stage, or what passes between stages: the lexer, parser and AST (`lexer.rs`, `parser.rs`, `ast.rs`), the checker (`check.rs` or `check/`) and `tir.rs`, codegen (`codegen.rs`, including symbol names and LLVM passes), linking (`link.rs`), diagnostics (`diagnostic.rs`); also which stage lowers which sugar | The stage paragraphs in `docs/architecture.md`; the diagram (step 4); the "Compiler" terms in `GLOSSARY.md` |
| Functions exported by `crates/runtime` | The Runtime paragraph in `docs/architecture.md`; the Runtime card in the diagram JSON |
| A language feature added, removed or renamed (a program in `crates/sisuc/tests/programs` added or changed) | "What works today" in `README.md`; `GLOSSARY.md` for the terms |
| A milestone starting or finishing | The milestone line in `README.md`; the milestone table in `docs/roadmap.md` |
| A choice the pull request body names as hard to reverse, with the alternatives it rejected | A new ADR in `docs/adr/`, numbered after the last one, following `docs/agents/domain.md`; "Decided in milestone N" in `docs/roadmap.md`. Any other choice gets no ADR. |
| Behavior that a "Decided in milestone N" bullet in `docs/roadmap.md` describes | Rewrite the bullet to the current fact and name the milestone that changed it, for example "desugared by the checker (moved from the parser in milestone 2)" |
| Diagnostic or panic text, or an exit code | The sample outputs and exit codes in `docs/development.md` |
| The toolchain or a prerequisite (`rust-toolchain.toml`, `scripts/`, `.cargo/`), a command, how tests run (`crates/sisuc/tests/*.rs`), CI (`.github/workflows/`, `prek.toml`), dependency policy (`deny.toml`) or lint policy (`[workspace.lints]` in `Cargo.toml`) | "Prerequisites" and "Build and test" in `docs/development.md`; "Commands" and "Code rules" in `AGENTS.md`; step 5 of `CONTRIBUTING.md` |
| A top-level directory or crate | "Repository layout" in `docs/development.md`; the crate list in `AGENTS.md` |
| `crates/sisuc/tests/programs/fib.sisu` | The example in `README.md`, which must stay identical to it |

If no row matches, report "no doc changes needed" and why. Do not edit to
show activity.

Never write to `docs/superpowers/`. It holds internal specs and plans, is
gitignored, and the docs do not link to it.

## 3. Verify before you write

- Every command and output in the docs comes from a run of the commit you
  document. Before a pull request, that is the branch's checkout. After a
  merge, make a worktree with `git worktree add $TMPDIR/sisu-main <merge-sha>`
  and set `LLVM_SYS_221_PREFIX` to an existing `.llvm/22`, because a new
  worktree has none. Build with `cargo build --workspace` and run that
  checkout's `target/debug/sisuc`; a binary from another checkout may come
  from another branch. Never write output from memory or from the diff.
- Write the executables you compile to `$TMPDIR`, not the repository root.
  Keep source paths as the docs show them, because panic messages quote them.
- Confirm each path, flag and function name in the code. Use CodeGraph when
  `.codegraph/` exists, otherwise grep.
- Link to a file that exists on `main` or that this change adds. Write a path
  that only another unmerged branch has as code, not as a link.
- Use the terms in `GLOSSARY.md` as spelled there, for example `tir` and
  poison type.
- A change that contradicts an ADR gets a new ADR that supersedes it. Do not
  edit the old ADR's decision.

## 4. Write

- If the `clarity` skill is available, use it in rewrite mode on each
  paragraph you add or rewrite.
- Match the surrounding text: short sentences, present tense, the same line
  width.
- Describe what the code does now. Status words such as "in progress" or
  "planned" belong only in the README milestone line and the roadmap.
- Keep the README short. A new capability is one bullet, not a section.
- The diagram: edit `docs/architecture/sisu-pipeline.json`, then regenerate
  both SVGs as "Updating the diagram" in `docs/architecture.md` describes.
  Never edit the SVGs by hand. If you cannot run archify, update the JSON
  and report that the SVGs are stale.

## 5. Check

```console
$ python3 .agents/skills/update-docs/scripts/check_links.py README.md CONTRIBUTING.md AGENTS.md GLOSSARY.md docs/*.md docs/adr/*.md docs/agents/*.md
broken: 0
$ awk '/^```/{n++;next} n==1' README.md | diff - crates/sisuc/tests/programs/fib.sisu
$ prek run --files <each changed file>
```

The `awk` line prints nothing when the README's first code block matches
`fib.sisu`.

## 6. Report and commit

Report, in this order:

1. Each file you changed, with one line on why.
2. How you verified each new claim: the command you ran, or the code you read.
3. Each row from step 2 you checked and left alone, with the reason.
4. Anything still stale, such as SVGs you could not regenerate.

Before a pull request, commit the doc changes on its branch. After a merge,
put them on a new `docs/<topic>` branch, open a pull request, and remove the
worktree. Never merge it; the user reviews and merges.
